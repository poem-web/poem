/// `#[handler]`([`handler`]) macro marks the following method can be used for handle api request.
///
/// Struct [`Path`] in param part is used for getting the path value and bind the variable defined
/// in `Path<name>`.
///
/// The path value can support any data structure which implemented [`Eq`], [`PartialEq`], [`Copy`],
/// string and numeric ones were in recommended.
///
/// Returned data will be set as the response against api's request if no more configuration or other

///
/// `#[tokio::main]`([`tokio::main`]) was in necessary as poem was depend on it.
///
/// [`tracing_subscriber`] was an optional component which was used for collecting the tracing labels.
///
/// [`Route`] hold the routers in service, the definition would be like: 
/// `Route::new().at("$path", $http_method($handler_method)); => Route::new().at("/hello/:name", get(hello));`
///
/// Function [`at`] is used for defined the end point of api, and bind the handler method against the api.
/// The variable name (`:name` in this sample) must be the same with the key defined by [`Path(T)`]
/// in input parameter of handler method (`Path(name)` in this sample)
///
/// The `$http_method` ([`get`] in this sample) defines the accept route method of the api.
///
/// The `$handler_method` ([`hello`] in this sample) point out the method which would handle request
/// for this api.
///
/// The other parts, maintain the server and tcp listener were the same with the sample code in
/// <The Book>.
///
/// usage:
/// 1. build & start the main.rs
/// 2. curl the url: `http://localhost:3000/hello/$name`
/// 3. "hello $name" will be returned
